# Alexandre Cremer

**Machine Learning Engineer | Robotics & Intelligent Systems Engineer**

I design and build intelligent systems that connect machine learning, real-time robotics and embedded execution.

My work spans the full AI development stack — from dataset engineering and assisted annotation pipelines to model training, architectural evaluation and integration into robotic systems operating in real environments.

I am particularly focused on perception systems for robotics and applied computer vision.
